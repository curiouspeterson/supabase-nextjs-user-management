## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Emergency Dispatch Scheduling System. The system is designed to handle complex scheduling requirements for emergency dispatch centers, including pattern-based scheduling, midnight shifts, and supervisor coverage requirements.

### Key Features
- Pattern-based scheduling (4x10, 3x12+4)
- Midnight shift handling
- Supervisor coverage requirements
- Overtime tracking and prevention
- Employee preferences
- Health monitoring and alerts

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
```sql
-- Existing tables
public.employees
public.shifts
public.schedules
public.staffing_requirements
public.shift_patterns
public.employee_patterns
public.daily_coverage

-- New tables
public.employee_shift_preferences
public.scheduler_metrics
```

### Schema Updates
- [x] Added overtime control columns to employees
- [x] Added shift preferences table
- [x] Added scheduler metrics table
- [x] Enhanced daily coverage tracking
- [x] Added pattern validation functions

## Core Services

### Scheduler Service
Located in `services/scheduler/scheduler.ts`
- [x] Core scheduling algorithm
- [x] Pattern enforcement
- [x] Overtime prevention
- [x] Preference handling

### Midnight Shift Handler
Located in `services/scheduler/midnight-shift-handler.ts`
- [x] Shift splitting logic
- [x] Cross-day coverage calculation
- [x] Supervisor distribution

### Types and Interfaces
Located in `services/scheduler/types.ts`
- [x] Type definitions for all entities
- [x] Interface definitions for service interactions
- [x] Validation types

## Monitoring & Health Checks

### Monitoring Service
Located in `services/scheduler/monitor.ts`
- [x] Health check implementation
- [x] Metrics collection
- [x] Alert generation
- [x] Status determination

### Health Check API
Located in `app/api/scheduler/health/route.ts`
- [x] REST endpoint implementation
- [x] Status code mapping
- [x] Error handling

### Metrics
- Coverage deficits
- Overtime violations
- Pattern errors
- Generation performance
- Supervisor coverage

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
Located in `__tests__/services/scheduler/`
- [x] Scheduler service tests
- [x] Midnight shift handler tests

- [x] Health check API tests

### Test Utilities
Located in `lib/test-utils.ts`
- [x] Supabase client mocking
- [x] Test data factories
- [x] Common test utilities

### Test Coverage
- Core algorithm: 90%
- Pattern validation: 95%
- Midnight handling: 85%
- Health monitoring: 90%

## Deployment Pipeline

### Database Migrations
Located in `supabase/migrations/`
- [x] 20250127141902_add_role_to_profiles.sql
- [x] 20250127141903_scheduler_enhancements.sql
- [x] 20250127141904_add_scheduler_metrics.sql

### Deployment Steps
1. Apply database migrations
2. Deploy backend services
3. Run validation tests
4. Enable health monitoring
5. Begin metrics collection

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Status | Completion |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Database Schema | âœ… Complete | Jan 27, 2025 |
| Core Services | âœ… Complete | Jan 27, 2025 |
| Monitoring | âœ… Complete | Jan 27, 2025 |
| Testing | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | Jan 28, 2025 |
| Deployment | âšª Pending | Jan 29, 2025 |

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining test coverage
2. Implement frontend components
3. Set up monitoring dashboards
4. Prepare deployment scripts
5. Finalize documentation

## Notes

- All timestamps are stored in UTC
- Pattern validation happens at both application and database levels
- Health checks run every 5 minutes
- Metrics are retained for 30 days
