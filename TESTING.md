# Testing Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy and current state of test coverage for the application.

### Test Structure

The test suite is organized into the following categories:

1. **Component Tests** (`__tests__/components/`)
   - UI Components
     - ✅ Button
     - ✅ Card
     - ✅ Table
     - ✅ Dialog
     - ✅ Toast
     - ✅ Alert
     - ✅ Select
     - ✅ Textarea
     - ✅ Checkbox
   - Feature Components
     - ✅ Navigation
     - ✅ TimeOffRequestForm

2. **API Route Tests** (`__tests__/api/`)
   - ✅ Users API
   - ✅ Employees API
   - ✅ Schedules API

3. **Integration Tests**
   - ✅ Authentication Flow
   - ✅ Time Off Request Flow
   - ⚠️ Employee Management Flow (partial)
   - ⚠️ Schedule Management Flow (partial)

4. **E2E Tests** (`e2e/`)
   - ✅ Authentication
   - ✅ Time Off Management
   - ⚠️ Employee Management (partial)
   - ⚠️ Schedule Management (partial)

## Current Test Coverage

### Completed
- Basic UI components with comprehensive test coverage
- Core API routes with error handling and validation tests
- Authentication flows
- Time off request functionality

### In Progress
- Employee management features
- Schedule management features
- Advanced integration scenarios

### Planned
- Performance testing
- Load testing for API routes
- Cross-browser compatibility tests
- Mobile responsiveness tests

## Best Practices

1. **Component Testing**
   - Test both success and error states
   - Verify accessibility features
   - Test responsive behavior
   - Mock external dependencies

2. **API Testing**
   - Validate request/response formats
   - Test error handling
   - Check authorization rules
   - Mock database interactions

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Test complete user flows
   - Verify state management
   - Test cross-component interactions

4. **E2E Testing**
   - Cover critical user journeys
   - Test in production-like environment
   - Include mobile and desktop scenarios

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test path/to/test

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Next Steps

1. Complete employee management tests
2. Add schedule management test coverage
3. Implement performance testing suite
4. Add cross-browser testing configuration
5. Set up continuous integration test workflow
